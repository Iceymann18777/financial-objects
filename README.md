# FINOS Financial Objects Special Interest Group

The Financial Objects Special Interest Group (SIG) provides a neutral forum for individuals across the financial services industry to collectively identify the need for new, open, financial objects standards as well as modifications to existing ones. The goal of the Financial Objects Special Interest Group is to promote adoption of financial object definitions and models that support common industry workflows and use cases.

## Join an ongoing modeling effort

### Commodities Payout Workstream

#### Overview
The Commodities Payout Workstream was [proposed](https://github.com/finos/community/issues/102) and is led by Goldman Sachs.

- **Business problem**: The ISDA CDM recently introduced its first instance of Commodities representation & looked to capture Payout terms of a vanilla swap. There are many other iterations of Commodities contracts that would benefit from a industry standard being created and the driver of this group is to continue to build the CDM and look to capture payouts associated with Commodity Options in the first instance.

- **Proposed solution**: Looking to tackle the Commodity Option payout first, the proposed solution will look to build on the existing generic option component with any additional terms that are relevant to commodities but not necessarily captured.

#### Contribute 
There are several ways to contribute to the **Commodities Payout workstream**:

## Product Control Common Template Workstream

#### Overview
The Product Control Common Template Workstream was [proposed](https://github.com/finos/community/issues/97) and is led by Goldman Sachs.

- **Business Problem**: there are multiple vendors currently providing consensus based pricing services and each vendor have their own template requirements. The different submission and consensus templates have increased the onboarding cost for participants to switch between / subscribe for multiple vendors. 

- **Proposed Solution**: to overcome this inconsistency, we are aiming to create an industry standard common template for submitting to and getting data back from vendors. This would help to streamline the submission process by applying a consistent approved format for this submission. This removes the dependence on template naming conventions and the cost when these are changed.

- **Approach**:
    - Construct a common template data model using Legend Studio.
    - This common template data model will become a candidate for inclusion to the CDM and will include all the attributes that each vendor is required to run their valuation process and return the consensus data to the banks.
    - Banks can connect their daily pricing data to the industry approved model for submission and vendor can leverage the same model to provide the consensus data. Thereby, both the banks and vendor will communicate in the same common model language.

#### Contribute
There are several ways to **contribute to the Product Control Common Template**:

- **Join the next meeting**: participants of the Product Control Common Template Workstream meet every Monday at 10am ET / 3pm GMT.

# Background 

The Financial Objects project was led by Johan Sandersson (Factset) and Hammad Akbar (Citi) until July 2020, when they expressed their intention to step down as project leads. See this GitHub issue _[Choose new project leads for FO](https://github.com/finos/finos-fo/issues/36)_ for context.

In November 2019, at FINOSâ€™ flagship conference, the Open Source Strategy Forum, FINOS Platinum member Goldman Sachs announced its intention to open source its internally developed [Legend](https://legend.finos.org) logical modeling language and visual data modeling platform, which is used to build, design, and execute data models.

Between April and September 2020, Goldman Sachs led several data modelling efforts as part of the [FINOS-Legend Studio Pilot](https://www.finos.org/hubfs/FINOS/assets/FINOS%20Legend%20Case%20Study%202021.pdf). The Pilot brought together developers and subject matter experts from financial institutions, technology firms and industry associations globally to develop extensions to the [ISDA Common Domain Model (CDM)](https://www.isda.org/2019/10/14/isda-common-domain-model/). Following the success of the [FINOS-Legend Studio Pilot](https://www.finos.org/hubfs/FINOS/assets/FINOS%20Legend%20Case%20Study%202021.pdf), with the proposed extensions being accepted and released by the ISDA Architecture and Review Committee, Goldman Sachs & ISDA stepped forward to re-purpose and lead the Financial Objects Special Interest Group within FINOS, to further promote common, standard data models, and eventually create new ones. 

Between July 2020 and February 2021, the FINOS Community engaged with a [Request for Comment on the Future of the Financial Objects project](https://github.com/finos/finos-fo/issues/38), and in February 2021, Ffion Acland from Goldman Sachs [stepped forward](https://groups.google.com/a/finos.org/g/community/c/7U3uS0GJ0QQ) to lead the Financial Objects project. Following a ten day period during which this proposal received support and no objections from the FINOS Community, Ffion Acland became the project lead on February 19th 2021. 

In January 2021, Goldman Sachs proposed and launched two work streams under the Financial Objects project: Commodities Payout and Product Control Common Template. Within a couple of months it became clear that while there are overarching, common elements to these work streams (modeling financial objects, using Legend & the FINOS hosted Legend Studio instance, and leveraging the ISDA CDM) every workstream has specific requirements that warrant separate governance structures. 

In line with the needs of the existing projects, in April 2021, the FINOS Governing Board [approved](https://github.com/finos/community/tree/master/governance/special-interest-groups#special-interest-groups) uplifting the Financial Objects project into a Special Interest Group, so that the existing work streams could become separate projects with their own governance models. The goal of the Financial Objects SIG is to provide a neutral forum for individuals across the financial services industry to collectively identify the need for new, open, financial objects standards as well as modifications to existing ones. The Financial Objects SIG also aims to promote adoption of financial object definitions and models that support common industry workflows and use cases.
