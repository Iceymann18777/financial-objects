The Financial Objects project was led by Johan Sandersson (Factset) and Hammad Akbar (Citi) until July 2020, when they expressed their intention to step down as project leads. See this GitHub issue _[Choose new project leads for FO](https://github.com/finos/finos-fo/issues/36)_ for context.

Between July 2020 and February 2021, the FINOS Community engaged with a [Request for Comment on the Future of the Financial Objects project](https://github.com/finos/finos-fo/issues/38), and in February 2021, Ffion Acland from Goldman Sachs [stepped forward](https://groups.google.com/a/finos.org/g/community/c/7U3uS0GJ0QQ) to lead the Financial Objects project. Following a ten day period during which this proposal received support and no objections from the FINOS Community, Ffion Acland became the project lead on February 19th 2021. 

The FINOS Financial Objects project currently has two work streams: Commodities Payout and Product Control Common Template.

Financial Objects is hosted within, and governed by the policies of, the Fintech Open Source Foundation (FINOS). FINOS is an independent nonprofit organization focused on promoting open innovation within financial services.
