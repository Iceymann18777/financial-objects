# FINOS Financial Objects
Welcome to the Financial Objects project, led by Goldman Sachs and hosted by FINOS, The Fintech Open Source Foundation. 

All Financial Objects collaboration activities, including meeting minutes, are hosted on this [Financial Objects GitHub repository](https://github.com/finos/finos-fo), and in this [GitLab project](https://gitlab.legend.finos.org/legend-pilot/cdm). Activities prior to July 2020 can be found in the [Financial Objects project archive](https://fo.finos.org). 

For more information about FINOS project materials and communication, please review the [FINOS Governance](https://github.com/finos/community/blob/master/governance/Collaborative-Principles.md).

### Background 

The Financial Objects project was led by Johan Sandersson (Factset) and Hammad Akbar (Citi) until July 2020, when they expressed their intention to step down as project leads. See this GitHub issue _[Choose new project leads for FO](https://github.com/finos/finos-fo/issues/36)_ for context.

Between July 2020 and February 2021, the FINOS Community engaged with a [Request for Comment on the Future of the Financial Objects project](https://github.com/finos/finos-fo/issues/38), and in February 2021, Ffion Acland from Goldman Sachs [stepped forward](https://groups.google.com/a/finos.org/g/community/c/7U3uS0GJ0QQ) to lead the Financial Objects project. Following a ten day period during which this proposal received support and no objections from the FINOS Community, Ffion Acland became the project lead on February 19th 2021. 

The FINOS Financial Objects project currently has two work streams: Commodities Payout and Product Control Common Template.
